# Text Based Black Jack Game
Fully functional Black Jack Game in Python that allows users to enter a balance, bet a custom amount, and accurately executes "hits" or "stands".
The player plays against the computer which will interact just like a casino dealer would.

Things I learned:
- How to effectively problem solve and debug code as this was my first personal project.
- How to plan out a project.
- How to Create effective methods/functions.
